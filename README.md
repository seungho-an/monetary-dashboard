This dashboard tries to replicate a couple of figures from Afonso et al. 2025 (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1019): Figures 2, 4, and 5 using FRED data. Given that FRED has only weekly data for a couple of key variables, figures are not exactly the same. Due to the data limitation and for simplicity, the forecast of reserve elasticity employs the simple OLS approach. The files are updated automatically daily.
